%% has produced after every write (a read before end never blocks),
%% end, then drain until the session reports finished (after end, a
%% read on an empty spool blocks until the terminal bytes arrive). The
%% loop is written here rather than delegated to the binding's pump
%% convenience so it stands in the utility, at the same place, in
%% every language.
